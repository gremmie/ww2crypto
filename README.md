# ww2crypto

A web application for exploring several World War II era cipher machines
in your browser.

I created this project to teach myself Typescript and to get more experience
with React, Redux and MUI components.

The cipher machine simulations are based on the Python versions I created a while back:

- [Py-Enimga](https://github.com/gremmie/enigma) - Enigma machine (Germany)
- [m209](https://github.com/gremmie/m209) - M-209 (USA)
- [Purple](https://github.com/gremmie/purple) - PURPLE (Japan)

More to come as the project develops!
